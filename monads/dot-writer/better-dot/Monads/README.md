Practice writing monads
==========================

1. __Randomness__ - Create a monad that takes a source of randmoness and produces random data
2. __Dot Writer Monad__ - Create a writer to create dot files to visualize graphs w/o letting the
                          user have to deal with the headaches.
3. __Use IO/Randomness/Dot Writer__ - What it says on the tin.
